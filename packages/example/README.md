# @cvent/queue-nextjs-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) sample app to demonstrate the queue POC.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) with your browser to see the result. 
> The POC app injects several dummy sessions into the queue when you first load the page to showcase the waiting room funcitonality.
